# TuringMachineSimulator
This project was developed as a part of my coursework at UNESPAR (Universidade Estadual do Paraná) for the "Linguagens Formais e Autômatos" (Formal Languages and Automata) course. It provides a hands-on experience with a simplified Turing Machine, focusing on configuration setup, transitions, and the execution of Turing Machine operations.

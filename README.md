# üë®‚Äçüíª TuringMachineSimulator
This project was developed as a part of my coursework at UNESPAR (Universidade Estadual do Paran√°) for the "Linguagens Formais e Aut√¥matos" (Formal Languages and Automata) course. It provides a hands-on experience with a simplified Turing Machine, focusing on configuration setup, transitions, and the execution of Turing Machine operations.

Check the technical report [HERE](./relatorio.pdf).

## Compilation and Execution of the Program

Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the program folder `scr` is located.

Compile the source code by entering the following command:

`javac entities/Estados.java application/Program.java`

After compilation, execute the program by typing the following command:

`java application.Program`

## Program Usage


The usage instructions are within the program and are intuitive. You input basic information such as the alphabet, auxiliary alphabet, number of states, initial state, number of final states, final states, start marker, and blank symbol. After that, you fill in the transition table, and the magic happens.

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the simulator.

Important: **your states are organized starting from index 0**, so if, for example, you have 6 states, they are arranged as **[0],[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]**, and **not [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6]**!
